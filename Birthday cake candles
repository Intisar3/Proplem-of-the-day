"""

1) Initialize Variables:

tallest = 0: Start with the assumption that no candle is the tallest (height 0).

count = 0: We haven't counted any tallest candles yet, so initialize to 0.

2) Iterate Through Candle Heights:

for height in candles:: Loop through each candle's height in the list of candles.

Check if Current Candle is Taller:

if height > tallest:: If the current candle is taller than the current tallest, update the tallest.

tallest = height: Update tallest to the new height.

count = 1: Reset the count to 1 since we've found a new tallest candle.

3) Check if Current Candle Equals Tallest:

elif height == tallest:: If the current candle has the same height as the tallest one.

count += 1: Increment the count because we found another candle of the same tallest height.

Return the Result:

return count: After looping through all candles, return the count of the tallest candles.
